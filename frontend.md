# Frontend Materials

- Read javascript.info
- Read a bunch of MDN docs and just have a browse around like, modern html stuff, browser APIs etc.
  Practice javascript trivia mock interview questions, there are lots of good ones here: <https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/javascript-questions> and here: <https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/js/quiz>, also try and come up with your own. Do them back and forth with someone else. This didn't end up being hugely useful for the interviews (the trivia I got was very simple) but I did learn a lot about JS quirks from this and it helps to talk about that stuff when you're coding in your technical.
- Do some of the more esoteric Javascript questions like implementing your own Promise.all or whatever, there are some in the above resources and also these are good: <https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/>. Same as above, just helps with deeper understanding of the language and gives you things to talk about while you code in TA. I didn't complete my solution but I got through cos I was able to yap about trade-offs, approaches etc of the language even while I failed to solve the problem.
- Grind through these: <https://sadanandpai.github.io/frontend-mini-challenges/> the more the better. These are like your leetcodes for FE interviews IMO. Ideally do them in a mock interview type environment with someone else going for FE positions.
