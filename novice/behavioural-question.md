# Bahavioural Question

## Project 1 - MyTimeTable

### Challenge

Hard to organise the data and state from backend

### Mistakes / Failures

Didn't do end-to-end test with backend and failed the first production

### Enjoyed

A lot of students said it's very helpful and cool

### Leadership

Manage the whole project and ask students to get involved.

### Conflicts

Some students suggest some features but I found it won't be widely used so eventually I made it as another project.

### What You'd Do Differently

Consider refactoring with a more organised data structure to support more features.

## Project 2 - React Hook Form Antd

### Challenge

Build a maintainable package for community and cover all the usage with two libraries.

### Mistakes / Failures

Didn't considered some use cases before users raise the issues.

### Enjoyed

Got added on react hook form website by its author, got over 2k download on npm.

### Leadership

Help contributors to contribute and handle a bunch of issues with the help of other contributors in the community.

### Conflicts

None

### What You'd Do Differently

Consider more use cases when build a library that a lot of people will use.

## Project 3 - IsThat.AI

### Challenge

Styles and animations are tricky.

### Mistakes / Failures

Used too many new technologies including experimental features in nextjs. Caused a long time to solve the issue with refactoring.

### Enjoyed

First internship job and got liked by leader. Welcomed when the company posted on the social media.

### Leadership

After finishing the mvp, I helped other colleagues to work on this project and improve it with implementing issues.

### Conflicts

I wanted to have some online meetings to schedule the unsolved issues but the leader preferred remote work and async communication, he asked me to create issues on project management software which solved the problem and saved a lot of time.

### What You'd Do Differently

Plan the project and its tech stack beforehand. Avoid scheduling the hardest features at the end.
