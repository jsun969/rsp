## Project 1 - MyTimeTable

### Challenge

Hard to organise the data and state from backend

### Mistakes / Failures

Didn't do end-to-end test with backend and failed the first production

### Enjoyed

A lot of students said it's very helpful and cool

### Leadership

Manage the whole project and ask students to get involved.

### Conflicts

Some students suggest some features but I found it won't be widely used so eventually I made it as another project.

### What You'd Do Differently

Consider refactoring with a more organised data structure to support more features.
